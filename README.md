PDFGenRustBindings
=======
Very incomplete (and by now abandoned) Rust bindings for the very useful [PDFGen](https://github.com/AndreRenaud/PDFGen) (bundling the C code). Just for a hobby project. You almost certainly shouldn't use these bindings, consider for example [printpdf](https://github.com/fschutt/printpdf) instead.
